## Database Schema:

### User Management:
1. **User Table:**
   - Fields: User ID (Primary Key), Username, Email, Password Hash, Role (Admin/User)
   - Purpose: Store user information for authentication and authorization.

### Schema and Configuration:
2. **Schema Table:**
   - Fields: Schema ID (Primary Key), User ID (Foreign Key), Schema Name, Description, Created Timestamp
   - Purpose: Store user-defined schemas, associating them with users.

3. **Table Table:**
   - Fields: Table ID (Primary Key), Schema ID (Foreign Key), Table Name, Description
   - Purpose: Store tables defined within schemas.

4. **Column Table:**
   - Fields: Column ID (Primary Key), Table ID (Foreign Key), Column Name, Data Type, Constraints (JSON)
   - Purpose: Store column definitions within tables, including data type and constraints.

5. **Sample Data Table:**
   - Fields: Sample Data ID (Primary Key), Column ID (Foreign Key), Data Value
   - Purpose: Store sample data for use in data generation, linked to specific columns.

### Generated Data:
6. **Generated Data Table:**
   - Fields: Data ID (Primary Key), Schema ID (Foreign Key), Table Name, Column Name, Generated Data Value
   - Purpose: Store the generated data for each column in the schema.

## System Architecture:

### Frontend:
- Develop a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js) for enhanced user experience.

### Backend:
- Build a backend server to handle business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
- Use a programming language and framework of choice (e.g., Python with Flask, Node.js with Express).
- Implement RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.

### Database:
- Use a relational database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store application data.
- Create appropriate indexes to optimize query performance.
- Implement database access control to ensure data security.

### File Processing:
- Develop a file parser module to extract schema information from uploaded ZIP files.
- Validate and sanitize user-provided data to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Data Generation:
- Implement data generation algorithms that generate synthetic data based on the defined schema and constraints.
- Ensure randomness and diversity in generated data.

### Export Functionality:
- Implement export functionality to generate output files in user-selected formats (e.g., CSV, SQL, JSON).
- Optimize data export for large datasets to prevent performance issues.

### User Authentication and Authorization:
- Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0.
- Define user roles (Admin/User) for authorization purposes.
- Enforce proper access controls based on user roles.

### Security:
- Encrypt sensitive information, such as user passwords and authentication tokens.
- Implement measures to protect against common web application security threats (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
- Regularly update and patch dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

### Documentation:
- Create comprehensive user documentation and guides on how to use the application.
- Document the schema definition format, supported data types, and API endpoints.

### Deployment:
- Deploy the application to a production server using a reliable hosting service (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
- Implement load balancing and scaling mechanisms to handle increased user traffic.
- Set up regular backups and disaster recovery procedures.

### Maintenance and Updates:
- Establish a process for ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and updates based on user feedback and changing requirements.
- Monitor server performance, application logs, and security alerts to proactively address issues.
