# Analysis Document: Aaku

## Introduction
The Aaku (Data Generator Application) is intended to provide users with a flexible tool for generating test data based on a relational schema. Users can define their schema and generate synthetic data for testing purposes. This analysis document will outline the key features and components of the application.

## User Requirements

### 1. Schema Definition
   - Users should be able to define a relational schema, specifying tables, columns, and relationships.
   - Allow users to upload a sample ZIP file containing multiple files to automatically infer schema structure.

### 2. Data Types
   - Provide a range of data types for users to choose from, including but not limited to Name, Country, City, Integer, Date, etc.
   - Allow users to customize data types and constraints for each column.

### 3. Data Generation
   - Support the generation of test data for the defined schema.
   - Generate data that adheres to specified data types and constraints.
   - Allow users to specify the quantity of data to generate.

### 4. Preview and Validation
   - Provide a preview of generated data before finalization.
   - Validate generated data against schema constraints and notify users of any errors.

### 5. Export Options
   - Enable users to export generated data in various formats (CSV, SQL, JSON, etc.).
   - Support the option to export schema definition for documentation.

### 6. User Management
   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Allow users to save and load their schema and data generation configurations.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Frontend
   - Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the application.
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

### 2. Backend
   - Build a backend server to handle schema definition, data generation, and exports.
   - Use a programming language and framework of choice (e.g., Python with Flask, Node.js with Express).

### 3. Database
   - Store user-defined schemas and configurations in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
   - Ensure data security and privacy through proper database access controls.

### 4. File Processing
   - Implement a file parser to extract schema information from uploaded ZIP files.
   - Validate and sanitize user-provided data to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### 5. Data Generation
   - Develop algorithms for generating synthetic data based on specified data types and constraints.
   - Ensure randomness and diversity in generated data.

### 6. Export Functionality
   - Implement export functionality to generate output files in user-selected formats.
   - Handle large datasets efficiently to prevent performance issues.

### 7. Security
   - Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
   - Encrypt sensitive information and use secure authentication practices.

### 8. Documentation
   - Provide user documentation and guides on how to use the application.
   - Document the schema definition format and supported data types.

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
   - Define the project scope and requirements.
   - Design the database schema and system architecture.
   - Create wireframes and mockups of the user interface.

### Phase 2: Development
   - Develop the frontend and backend components.
   - Implement schema definition and data generation logic.
   - Build export and preview features.

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
   - Perform extensive testing of the application, including unit tests and user acceptance testing.
   - Address any bugs or issues identified during testing.

### Phase 4: Security and User Management
   - Implement security measures, including user authentication and data encryption.
   - Integrate user management functionality.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment
   - Create user guides and documentation.
   - Deploy the application to a production server with appropriate hosting and scaling.

### Phase 6: Maintenance and Updates
   - Provide ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and updates as needed.
   - Gather user feedback for future enhancements.
