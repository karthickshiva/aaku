## Project Scope and Requirements

### 1. Introduction
The Aaku (Data Generator Application) aims to provide users with a powerful tool for defining relational schemas and generating synthetic test data. The application will be designed to meet the following scope and requirements.

### 2. User Requirements

#### 2.1 Schema Definition
   - **R1.1:** Users should be able to create a relational schema.
   - **R1.2:** Users can define tables, columns, and relationships within the schema.
   - **R1.3:** Users have the option to upload a sample ZIP file containing multiple files to automatically infer schema structure.

#### 2.2 Data Types
   - **R2.1:** Users can choose from a range of predefined data types such as Name, Country, City, Integer, Date, etc.
   - **R2.2:** Users can customize data types and constraints for each column, including data format, length, and validation rules.

#### 2.3 Data Generation
   - **R3.1:** The application should support the generation of synthetic test data for the defined schema.
   - **R3.2:** Data generation should adhere to specified data types and constraints.
   - **R3.3:** Users can specify the quantity of data to generate.

#### 2.4 Preview and Validation
   - **R4.1:** Users should have the ability to preview generated data before finalization.
   - **R4.2:** The application must validate generated data against schema constraints and provide error notifications.

#### 2.5 Export Options
   - **R5.1:** Users can export generated data in various formats, including CSV, SQL, JSON, etc.
   - **R5.2:** The application should support exporting the schema definition for documentation purposes.

#### 2.6 User Management
   - **R6.1:** Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - **R6.2:** Users can save and load their schema and data generation configurations.

### 3. Technical Requirements

#### 3.1 Frontend
   - **R7.1:** Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the application.
   - **R7.2:** Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

#### 3.2 Backend
   - **R8.1:** Build a backend server to handle schema definition, data generation, and exports.
   - **R8.2:** Use a programming language and framework of choice (e.g., Python with Flask, Node.js with Express).

#### 3.3 Database
   - **R9.1:** Store user-defined schemas and configurations in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
   - **R9.2:** Ensure data security and privacy through proper database access controls.

#### 3.4 File Processing
   - **R10.1:** Implement a file parser to extract schema information from uploaded ZIP files.
   - **R10.2:** Validate and sanitize user-provided data to prevent security vulnerabilities.

#### 3.5 Data Generation
   - **R11.1:** Develop algorithms for generating synthetic data based on specified data types and constraints.
   - **R11.2:** Ensure randomness and diversity in generated data.

#### 3.6 Export Functionality
   - **R12.1:** Implement export functionality to generate output files in user-selected formats.
   - **R12.2:** Handle large datasets efficiently to prevent performance issues.

#### 3.7 Security
   - **R13.1:** Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
   - **R13.2:** Encrypt sensitive information and use secure authentication practices.

#### 3.8 Documentation
   - **R14.1:** Provide user documentation and guides on how to use the application.
   - **R14.2:** Document the schema definition format and supported data types.

### 4. Project Timeline

#### 4.1 Phase 1: Planning and Design
   - **R15.1:** Define the project scope and requirements.
   - **R15.2:** Design the database schema and system architecture.
   - **R15.3:** Create wireframes and mockups of the user interface.

#### 4.2 Phase 2: Development
   - **R16.1:** Develop the frontend and backend components.
   - **R16.2:** Implement schema definition and data generation logic.
   - **R16.3:** Build export and preview features.

#### 4.3 Phase 3: Testing and Validation
   - **R17.1:** Perform extensive testing of the application, including unit tests and user acceptance testing.
   - **R17.2:** Address any bugs or issues identified during testing.

#### 4.4 Phase 4: Security and User Management
   - **R18.1:** Implement security measures, including user authentication and data encryption.
   - **R18.2:** Integrate user management functionality.

#### 4.5 Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment
   - **R19.1:** Create user guides and documentation.
   - **R19.2:** Deploy the application to a production server with appropriate hosting and scaling.

#### 4.6 Phase 6: Maintenance and Updates
   - **R20.1:** Provide ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and updates as needed.
   - **R20.2:** Gather user feedback for future enhancements.
